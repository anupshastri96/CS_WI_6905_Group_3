Tech Stack
Frontend (User Interface)

Since the UI needs to be interactive, responsive, and modern, the best approach is to use:

    React.js (for component-based UI)
    Next.js (for server-side rendering and better SEO, optional)
    Tailwind CSS (for easy styling)
    Axios (for API communication)

Backend

To handle API requests, authentication, and data processing:

    Node.js with Express.js (lightweight backend framework)
    MongoDB Atlas (NoSQL Database) for on-premise training storage
    Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL) for medical history and inference results
    Amazon S3 (for storing X-ray images)
    Amazon API Gateway (to manage API requests)
    AWS Lambda (for serverless execution, optional)
    AWS EC2 (for hosting the backend and web app)

Machine Learning

    Python (FastAPI/Flask) for Model Inference API
    Federated Learning with Flower framework
    PyTorch or TensorFlow (for CNN model training)
    Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) for running the federated learning aggregator

Security & Authentication

    AWS Cognito (for user authentication)
    JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management
    AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) for role-based access control
    SSL/TLS Encryption (for secure data transfer)



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
